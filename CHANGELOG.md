SCPN Spheromak Core — CHANGELOG

# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Level-0 device physics (`src/scpn_spheromak_core/physics/`), the third
  implemented capability at `computational_prototype` (ADR 0005): the
  cylindrical Taylor eigenvalue of the flux conserver with its
  wavenumbers, the relaxed-state Chandrasekhar–Kendall field on a
  declared grid of radial stations and axial divisions, and the formation
  disposition of the coaxial source against the eigenvalue, with a
  canonical `Level0PhysicsRecord`, explicit `ModelInputs` and two pinned
  reference digests. The Bessel functions, the zero and the unit circle
  are the shared kernel library's (`scpn-reactor-kernels`, ADR 0006): the
  library is the one runtime dependency pinned to a commit object in
  `pyproject.toml`, the manifest records the same commit, the library's
  kernel-inventory digest and the consumed kernels in a new optional
  `kernel_library` block enforced by the validator, and declares the
  excluded domain `shared_physics_geometry_and_numerics_kernels`. Native
  kernels (`rust/`, crate `scpn-spheromak-rs` depending on the library's
  Rust crate at the same commit, optional distribution
  `scpn-spheromak-native`) reproduce every value bit for bit, proven by
  parity tests; a standard-conformant benchmark
  (`benchmarks/level0_physics.py`) with a committed local artefact and
  `docs/benchmarks.md`. The manifest declares the capability and the
  owned domain `analytic_device_physics_models`; descriptor and inventory
  regenerated; the envelope fixture regenerated for the new
  `manifest_sha256` (plan bytes unchanged). Gates extended: `mypy` scope
  includes `benchmarks/` (and `make typecheck` now covers `src/`), CI
  installs the package with its pinned dependency, a `rust` CI job runs
  the crate gates, parity and a benchmark smoke, `make rust` locally.

### Changed

- Device configuration model: the Bessel zero of the cylindrical Taylor
  eigenvalue is the shared library's correctly rounded `j_{1,1}`
  (`3.8317059702075125`) instead of the literal `3.832`, and the
  eigenvalue is evaluated as `sqrt(k_r k_r + k_z k_z)`; the value of any
  configuration changes in the fourth significant figure and the level-0
  physics reproduces it bit for bit (ADR 0002 addendum).

- Diagnostic-plan depth: per-channel signal inventories, frame
  transformations with a fixed kind-admissibility table and connectivity
  rule, and a clock topology partitioning the physical clocks into rooted
  domains with a star of relations to the reference root. Envelope
  `scpn.reactor-diagnostic-plan-envelope.v1` bumped to `1.2.0`; the
  fixture is regenerated from the public surface and re-pinned. All new
  members are declarations: no observation, phase, mapping, or control
  authority is created.

### Fixed

- Added the nullable `timing_uncertainty_s` channel member (always `null`;
  no event-relative candidate is applicable) so the diagnostic-plan
  channel shape matches the portfolio-uniform envelope 1.1.0 contract;
  fixture regenerated and re-pinned.

### Added

- Local gate parity with the wider ecosystem: the pre-commit chain now
  also runs REUSE licensing compliance and a typographical checker
  (`_typos.toml` carries the deliberate reactor vocabulary), and adds
  the upstream YAML, TOML, large-file and private-key guards. Licensing
  and spelling were previously verified only in hosted CI, so a broken
  REUSE annotation — including the aggregate annotation that covers the
  binary header images — could reach a push before being caught.
- Generated repository header artwork: `docs/assets/generate_header.py`
  renders three deterministic 1280x640 images from the repository's own
  domain surface (the compact toroid in its flux conserver used by the
  README, the no-external-TF-coil invariant, and the formation gate).
- Modular hosted-workflow surface per the ecosystem workflow-modularity
  standard: `ci.yml` reduced to a coordinator with a stable fail-closed
  `gate` job, single-responsibility reusable workflows for static
  analysis/repository policy and for tests, a versioned machine-readable
  inventory (`.github/workflow-inventory.json`,
  `scpn.workflow-inventory.v1` `1.0.0`), and a fail-closed modularity
  guard (`tools/audit_workflows.py`) enforced locally (preflight gate,
  pre-commit hook) and in hosted CI. The duplicate documentation-links
  step was removed from the CI chain; `docs.yml` remains the single
  owner of documentation validation.

- Typed reference frames, clock synchronisation relations (synthetic
  bounds only; no correlation evidence claimed), and per-channel
  acquisition windows and element counts in the diagnostic model;
  hardened decoders (recursive exact-key, duplicate-member, and
  byte-canonical refusal in both codecs); envelope `1.1.0` adding
  `manifest_sha256` over the committed canonical `reactor-domain.json`
  (fixture regenerated; byte hash re-pinned in tests).

- Portable diagnostic-plan envelope
  (`src/scpn_spheromak_core/plan_envelope.py`,
  `scpn.reactor-diagnostic-plan-envelope.v1` version `1.0.0`): a
  producer-owned, canonically serialised wrapper carrying project
  identity, exact owned configurations, capability and maturity,
  synthetic/review-only/non-actuating statements, both SPO registry
  pins, the inner plan's SHA-256, the producer revision, and fixed
  no-observation/no-control non-claims; strict parsers refuse unknown,
  duplicate, and non-finite members, and an immutable committed fixture
  exercises the exchange end to end.

- Diagnostic and clock semantics model
  (`src/scpn_spheromak_core/observability.py`), the second implemented
  capability at `computational_prototype`: frozen clock, channel,
  deferral, and plan objects aligned fail-closed with the pinned SPO
  observability-profile catalogue (candidate applicability, carrier
  admissibility, exact class-fixed evidence vocabularies, clock-kind
  compatibility, Nyquist bounds); a cited advisory band check; canonical
  serialisation with SHA-256 digests and strict NaN-rejecting round-trip
  parsing (design record `docs/adr/0003-diagnostic-clock-semantics.md`).

- Device configuration model (`src/scpn_spheromak_core/`), the first implemented
  capability at `computational_prototype`: validated frozen parameter
  objects with device-specific invariants and documented, cited
  consistency estimates; canonical serialisation with SHA-256 digests
  and strict NaN-rejecting round-trip parsing; a data-only pin to the
  SPO reactor registry; and the reactor-domain validator branch
  enforcing populated capability inventories with the ADR 0002
  evidence-maturity ceiling rule (design record
  `docs/adr/0002-device-configuration-model.md`).

- Architecture-only repository scaffold: governance, security, licensing,
  REUSE metadata, contribution and support policies, and citation metadata.
- Machine-readable domain manifest `reactor-domain.json` binding the project
  to SCPN Phase Orchestrator reactor registry `1.0.0`
  (configuration `spheromak`).
- Device-owned CONTROL adapter specification and threat model.
- Derived Studio portfolio descriptor (`not_federated`) and generated
  capability inventory (zero implemented capabilities).
- Validation tooling: domain-manifest validator, descriptor derivation and
  inventory generation with drift checks, and a fail-closed preflight
  orchestrator, each with statement- and branch-complete tests.
- Continuous-integration, code-scanning, security-audit, documentation,
  SBOM, pre-commit, and Scorecard workflow definitions (read-only
  permissions; no publication or deployment workflows).

### Changed

- Studio portfolio descriptor schema ratified at version 1.1.0 after
  downstream review, before any consumer adoption (1.0.0 superseded
  unconsumed): canonical JSON Schema published in-repository with a strict
  unknown-field policy, explicit source repository, nullable lifecycle
  evidence pointer, nullable versioned control-intent reference, ratified
  capability item shape, and a machine-protection object (independent
  final-veto owner with availability `not_assessed`) replacing the former
  boolean flag.
