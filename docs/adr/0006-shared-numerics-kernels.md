# ADR 0006 — Consume the shared numerics kernels: the library pin

Status: accepted (2026-09-02). Companion of ADR 0005.

## Context

The level-0 models need the Bessel functions ``J0`` and ``J1``, the first
positive zero of ``J1``, and the sine and cosine of the axial phases. The
family's bit-exact rule admits only ``+ - * /`` and ``sqrt`` on the Python
floor plus vendored deterministic implementations of anything else,
mirrored operation for operation in the native crate; platform special
and trigonometric functions are outside the rule. The shared kernel
library of the research group, `scpn-reactor-kernels`, carries exactly
those kernels (its ADR 0005, kernel `numerics_bessel`: the NIST DLMF
10.2.2 ascending series in Horner form on ``|x| <= 8``, with the zeros as
the correctly rounded doubles of OEIS A115368 and A115369; its ADR 0002,
kernel `geometry_unit_circle`: vendored sine and cosine polynomials with
exact octant symmetry) with a Rust crate proven bit-exact against its
Python floor. Carrying a copy here would create the drift the library
exists to prevent.

## Decision

1. The repository declares `scpn-reactor-kernels` as its one runtime
   dependency, pinned to a commit object of the library's public
   repository (`pyproject.toml`, `dependencies`); no release of the
   library exists yet, so the commit is the exact identity.
2. The manifest carries the pin as the optional `kernel_library` block
   (distribution, version, `source_commit`, `inventory_sha256` of the
   library's generated `kernel-inventory.json` at that commit, and the
   sorted identifiers of the kernels consumed: `geometry_unit_circle`,
   `numerics_bessel`). The
   validator enforces every field; a contract test proves that the
   manifest, the `pyproject.toml` dependency, the installed package
   version, the native crate's `Cargo.toml` and `Cargo.lock` and the CI
   install steps name one commit.
3. `src/scpn_spheromak_core/physics/numerics.py` is the import site of the
   library for the physics (the configuration model imports the zero
   constant directly): it re-raises the library's domain refusal as the
   device `NumericsError` (a `DeviceConfigurationError`) with the
   library's message, so the consumer's error contract stays device-typed,
   and it re-exports the library's zero constant unchanged.
4. The native crate `scpn-spheromak-rs` depends on the library's Rust crate
   `scpn-reactor-kernels-rs` as a git dependency at the same commit (no
   default features); `Cargo.lock` records the source, and the hosted
   `rust` job fetches it. Parity is proven between this repository's
   Python floor and its own native module; the library's own parity
   covers the kernels themselves.
5. The manifest adds the excluded domain
   `shared_physics_geometry_and_numerics_kernels` owned by
   `SCPN-REACTOR-KERNELS`, mirroring the library's exclusion of device
   truth.

## Consequences

A change of the library pin is a governed data change of this repository
(manifest, descriptor and inventory regeneration, envelope fixture re-pin,
Cargo re-lock, SPO re-intake). The library's consumer table gains this
repository as its fifth consumer, the second of the Bessel kernel and
the first device to consume the unit-circle kernel outside a mesh;
because that entry changes the library's inventory, the digest pinned
here names the inventory at the pinned commit, never the one that lists
this consumer (the library's ADR 0004 fixes the same rule).
