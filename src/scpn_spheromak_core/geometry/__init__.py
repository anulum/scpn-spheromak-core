# SCPN Spheromak Core — device geometry, 3D model and CAD model

"""Device geometry, tier-G1 3D model and tier-G2 CAD model of the family.

A validated device geometry, the composed device model record of five
analytic bodies, the composed device CAD model record of the same five
bodies as B-rep solids on the pinned third-party OpenCASCADE kernel, and
the device-side provenance of the open-format exports (binary STL, glTF
2.0 binary, STEP). The unit circle, the tessellation primitives, the
closed-mesh contract, the serialisers and the B-rep, STEP, faceting and
evidence kernels are consumed from the pinned shared kernel library
``scpn_reactor_kernels``; the mesh type of every body is that library's
``TriangleMesh``. Every body is a synthetic design surface or solid;
nothing here is an equilibrium boundary or an engineering model, and no
value describes a real machine.
